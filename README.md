# ClimateWins Machine Learning Project
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing historical weather data and building machine learning models to predict future weather patterns in Europe.

## Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of historical weather data to predict future weather patterns in Europe. The project leverages machine learning techniques to develop accurate models that can aid in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. By analysing historical weather data, the aim is to uncover valuable insights into climate trends and make informed predictions about future weather conditions.

Note: The project was developed for the purposes of the Career Foundry's Data Analytics program.

## Business Questions
- How is machine learning used?
- Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favourable on a certain day?

- ## Data Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project and contains historical weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe. 
The data includes variables such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more, spanning from the late 1800s to 2022.
